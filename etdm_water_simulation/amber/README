# All input files were optimized for AMBER16 or above, so lower version of AMBER can cause some errors.
# In this script, the parallel (MPI) version is commented out. Use this line for parallel execution instead
# (adjust for your MPI and the number of CPUs you want to use). Alternatively, if you have access to
# pmemd.cuda or are willing to use sander, you can replace "pmemd" with pmemd.cuda or sander and "pmemd.MPI"
# with pmemd.cuda.MPI or sander.MPI
#
# There is a known issue in current CHARMM-GUI AMBER inputs with "sander".
# If you are willing to use "sander" for your simulation, please remove "&end" line in all minimization / equilibration
# inputs.
